### About

<p>
A tech blog application created with Sequelize, Express, and Handlebars.js can be used to allow users to create and manage their profiles, create posts related to technology, and comment on posts created by other users. Here is a brief overview of how such an application might function:

    User registration: Users can create their profile by registering with the application. They will provide details such as their name, email, and password.

    User login: Once registered, users can log in to the application to access their profile and create posts.

    Post creation: Users can create posts by providing a title and body text. Each post should be associated with the user who created it.

    Post editing: Users can edit the posts they have created, allowing them to update the title and body text as necessary.

    Commenting: Users can comment on posts created by other users. Each comment should be associated with the user who created it and the post it relates to.

    Post deletion: Users can delete the posts they have created if they no longer want them to be visible on the site.


The above functionality can be implemented using the Sequelize ORM to interact with a database, Express to define routes and handle HTTP requests, and Handlebars.js to render HTML templates. The application can be hosted on a platform like Heroku for public access.</p>
